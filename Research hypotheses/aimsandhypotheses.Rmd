## Study aims

1. What experiences and attitudes do symposium participants have towards open science in applied ecology?
  + Open ended questions
  + Background questions
2. What do they see as the benefits / risks for personal careers, ecological applications and teaching?
3. How are OS aspects learnt / taught / transferred to students?
  + At different levels of education?
  + What have they been taught/encouraged towards?
  + What have they taught (in class/supervision of ECRs)
  + What should be taught (in class/supervision of ECRs)
4. What are their projections for OS in applied ecology in the future?

## Hypotheses

1. Researchers who teach are more likely to include open science-related practices in their teaching if they also frequently engage in those practices as researchers.
2. Colloquium participants having less experience with open science-related practices are more likely to modify their definitions of open science after the colloquium.
3. Colloquium participants having less experience with open science-related practices are more likely to change ore adapt their open science related practices in research, teching and/or supervision after the colloquium.
4. Researchers with academic affiliation have engaged more in open science-related practices compared to other researchers, and more so for early-career researchers.
