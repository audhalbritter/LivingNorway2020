## Study aims

1. What experiences and attitudes do symposium participants have towards open science in applied ecology?
  + Open ended questions
  + Background questions
2. What do they see as the benefits / risks for personal careers, ecological applications and teaching?
3. How are OS aspects learnt / taught / transferred to students?
  + At different levels of education?
  + What have they been taught/encouraged towards?
  + What have they taught (in class/supervision of ECRs)
  + What should be taught (in class/supervision of ECRs)
4. What are their projections for OS in applied ecology in the future?


# Living Norway 2020: Attitudes to OS




## Hypotheses

We could possibly group these under some subheadings, e.g. 

1. Experience should help - in terms of both recognising the need for and the uptake of OS practices in, and as a subject of, teaching
2. Workshops such as ours can give people experience - both in terms of concepts and practical
3. Current experience/emphases are uneven between OS in e.g. data, code, publication - showing success in some aspects, but less in others. Are these the bits that are easiest/least controversial? 

More detailed questions:

1. Researchers who teach are more likely to include open science-related practices in their teaching if they also frequently engage in those practices as researchers.
2. Colloquium participants having less experience with open science-related practices are more likely to modify their definitions of open science after the colloquium.
3. Colloquium participants having less experience with open science-related practices are more likely to change or adapt their open science related practices in research, teching and/or supervision after the colloquium.
4. Researchers with academic affiliation have engaged more in open science-related practices compared to other researchers, and more so for early-career researchers.

5. Colloqium participants "think" OS practices are more important in their research compared to teaching and supervision.
6. OS practices are perceived to be more important in data, methods and publishing than educational tools and code. BUT...
7. Most people have used open data and code, but have not contributed to open data and code. 

Gender patterns - perhaps can be more 'exploratory' in nature?
