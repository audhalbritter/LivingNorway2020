# Living Norway 2020: Attitudes to OS

## Predictions/driving questions

Overarching theme: propagation of open science, knowledge and culture (how to do this better), unbalanced value of OS aspects and future outlook

### 0. Are there diverging attitudes by gender? (uneven workloads, uneven confidence, uneven altruism)
Gender patterns - perhaps more 'exploratory' in nature - can be nested under all of the other questions
### 1. Current experience/emphases and perceived importance are uneven between types of OS practices in e.g. data, code, publication - showing success in some aspects, but less in others. Are these the bits that are easiest/least controversial? 
1.1 Researchers with academic affiliation have engaged more in open science-related practices compared to other researchers, and more so for early-career researchers.
Academic affiliation
Year of degree
# of open science practices engaged in
gender
1.2 OS practices are perceived to be more important in data, methods and publishing than educational tools and code, depending on activities engaged in. 
Perception of importance of OS practices

1.3 BUT…Most people have used open data and code, but have not contributed to open data and code.

### 2. Workshops such as ours can give people experience - both in terms of concepts and practical
2.1 Colloquium participants having less experience with open science-related practices are more likely to change or adapt their open science related practices in research, teaching and/or supervision after the colloquium.

2.2 Motivation for doing the workshop - experience with OS practices

2.3 Statements of use in the future vs used in the past -- predictor also: stated usefulness of the workshop … (open ended answers available to qualify)
### 3. Experience should help - in terms of both recognising the need for and the uptake of OS practices in, and as a subject of, teaching
(propagation of open science culture)

3.1 Researchers who teach are more likely to include open science-related practices in their teaching if they also frequently engage in those practices as researchers.


3.2 Colloquium participants having more experience with being taught open science-related practices are more likely to engage in those practices as researchers, and teachers.

3.4 Colloquium participants "think" OS practices are more important in their research compared to teaching and supervision.

### 4. Future of open science. 
4.1 What are the hurdles and hindrances preventing people from doing OS
Perceived hurdles and hindrances by level of experience, gender, institution?
4.2 What are the factors helping people to do OS
 Do they differ with levels of experience, gender, institution?
4.3 What are the solutions that they propose? Where would they see open science in 10 years
associate with hurdles/hinderances
can associate with perceived importance of different practices

## Study aims

1. What experiences and attitudes do symposium participants have towards open science in applied ecology?
  + Open ended questions
  + Background questions
2. What do they see as the benefits / risks for personal careers, ecological applications and teaching?
3. How are OS aspects learnt / taught / transferred to students?
  + At different levels of education?
  + What have they been taught/encouraged towards?
  + What have they taught (in class/supervision of ECRs)
  + What should be taught (in class/supervision of ECRs)
4. What are their projections for OS in applied ecology in the future?
