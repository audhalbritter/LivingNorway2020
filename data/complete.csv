"<p>For me, Open Science is 1) scientific data and results open for all the scientific community, without obligation to pay subscription fee for the journal of pay for particular scientific article (I am scientist/biologist in a poor country or country with low interest for science and ecology, whatever authorities would say) and (not mutually exclusive) 2) scientific data and results &quot;translated&quot; to common people, to overall community.</p>";I don?t know;I don?t know;I don?t know;Several times a year;I don?t know;Rarely;Several times a year;Several times a week;Several times a year;Rarely;;"<p>First, fees that should be payed for publishing in some Open Access journals.
