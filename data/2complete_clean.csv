The idea is that students are taught a reproducible workflow and use it to follow a research project from beginning to end, archiving data and code on Open Science Framework (OSF), and eventually presenting the results. They use R and RStudio, and share code with classmates, and do version control through OSF.

Specific courses need not necessarily focus on all elements of OS, but with aligned course development throughout a degree structure, could be set up to ensure students are exposed to each of the core elements; why OS is important, why data management is key, an emphasis on using Open Source education tools (and analytical tools), so classes maintain the use of a single software platform throughout a degree structure, i.e. R, rather than using different ones in each course, ensuring assignment submisions reflect OS practices, i.e. there is consideration of transparency in decision making, and code-based submissions are encouraged to consider replicability as part of the assignment marking criteria.</li><li>On a more personal level - I am keenly interested in teaching research intensive field courses, or project based courses, which try to reflect research practice already. These provide a perfect platform for integrating OS into workflows. For example, project proposals may become styled as registered reports for higher level classes, methodological protocols should be in line with discipline standards and documented in such a manner as to be reusable in future course iterations, as with the data, which should be stored in a manner that enables it to be interopable with future courses, and perhaps published as a contribution to science more formally. In these courses, specifific workshops and tutorials on how and why these OS practices should be used would be included, along with OS being an explicit part of the learning objectives (something which is often assumed, but not always explicitly stated).</li><li>Regarding supervising of students, be that at UG, or graduate level - part of the workflow would be on ensuring any research project is conducted with OS in mind. This integrates many of the points above, regarding data management, analysis and notetaking, but also would extend to elements such as if reviews are done - are they, where suitable, following evidence synthesis protocols? In getting funding for graduate students, where possible, ensuring money is sought for Open Access publication and data lodging would be prioritised, as in some cases, ECRs are hampered by existing lab practices when in comes to OS publicaitons - and they should not be penalized for decisions outside of their control.&nbsp;</li></ul>";No;;;"<ul><li>Introductory discussions for students on the importance of OS, why it&#39;s a critical part of our research projects /lab dynamics and thus why they will also be required to follow those principles.</li><li>Provide a scaffold of how we a) already adopt OS principles within the research/lab, and b) how we&#39;re adopting new principles /approaches as they develop.

54;No;;;"<p>It seems clear that people need a) more competency in terms of coding to ensure that methodologies are repeatable, b) an awareness of data structures and file organisation, c) confidence that data and code doesn&#39;t need to be perfect for sharing. At a coursework level, using&nbsp;more open data in examples, teaching about standards and why they are important. Letting them see how easily accessible and what a fantastic resource open data is.

I would encourage students (and others) to visit a librarian early in their projects, and make use of the services that they can offer. I would try to encourage use of open data sharing / coding (rather than just emailing documents) within a group, to lean how to do this in a safe environment. I would try to encourage more code sharing within teams, as a first step. I think having an awareness of open data from both user and creator would be useful, so having students have a component of both would be great.
